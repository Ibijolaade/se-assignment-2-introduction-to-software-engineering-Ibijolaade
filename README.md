Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Answer: Software Engineering is the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, iplementation, testing and documentation of software. - IEEE systems and software engineering-vocabulary, ISO/IEC/IEEE st 24765:2010(E).

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Answer: Software Engineering is made of two words, software; the collection of executable programming code, associated libaries and documentation, while engineering; is the development of products, using well defined scientific principles and methods. Software Engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications to solve real-world problems by adhering to a set of engineering principles and best practices. Software engineering is concerned with developing software products that are reliable, efficient and easy to maintain, it applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems, while traditional programming on the other hand is mainly concerned with writing code to solve specific problems. 
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): This is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software in the shortest possible production time and Agile is the most common SDLC used in companies today.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Answer: 1. Planning Phase: The planning phase typically includes resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning. The development team collects inputs are also collected from the stakeholders involed in the projects and they also determine what resources are required to satisfy the project requirements. 2. Coding Phase: This phase includes system design in an integrated development environment. It also includes static code analysis and code review for multipe types of devices. 3. Building Phase: The building phase takes the code requirements detrmine dearlier and use those to begin actually building the software. 4. Testing Phase: This phase entails the veluation of teh created software. The testing team evaluates the developed product(s) in order to assess whether they meet the requirements specified in the plannig phase. 5. Release Phase: This phase involves tye team packaging, managing and deploying releases across different environments. 6. Deploy Phase: In the delopyment phase, the software is officially released into the production environment. 7. Operate Phase: The operate phase entails the use of the software in the production environment. 8. Monitor Phase: In this phase, various elements of the software are monitored. These could include the overall system performance, user exeperience, new security vulnerabilities, ana anlysis of bugs or errors in the system.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile Methodology; Approach: Frequent stakeholder interaction, Flexibility: High, Requires: Team initiative and short-term deadlines. VS Waterfall Methodology; Approach: Hands-off; goals and outcome established from the beggining, Flexibility: Low, Requires: Completing deliverables to progress to the next phase. 

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Answer: Agile is an iterative, incremental, and adaptive approach to software development. Agile teams work in short sprints, typically two or four weeks long, and focus on delivering small, usable pieces of software at the end of each sprint. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, priotize flexibilty, collaboration and customer satisfaction, and are well suited for projects with changing requirements and uncertainty. Waterfall, on the other hand, is a more traditional, linear approach to software development. In waterfall, development is divided into distinct phases such as requirements gathering, design, developmet, testing and delopyment. Each phase must be completed before the next one can begin. Watefall is known for its well-defined process and is often used in projects where requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change. 
Agile Scenario; A software development company is creating a mobile app with rapidly changing requirements and the need for frequent user feedback. Agile is preferred to enable iterative development, quick adaptations, and regular client collaboration. Waterfall Scenario; A government agency is developing a compliance-driven software system with well-defined requirements and strict regulatory standards. waterfall is preferred to ensure a structured, sequential approach with thorough documentation and validation at each phase. 

Requirements Engineering: Requirements Engineering as its name suggest, it is the engineering discipline of establishing user requirements and specifying software systems. - (Zave, 1995)

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Answer: Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the needs and functinalities of a system as required b stakeholders. it ensures that the system meets the intended purpose by gathering detailed requirements, analyzing them and translating them into clear specifications for developers and project managers. The processes of Requirement Engineering; 1. Elicitation: This process gathers requirements from stakeholders through various techniques. 2. Analysis: This process prioritize and evaluate requirements for clarity and feasibility. 3. Specificaton: This process documents detailed requirements, creating use cases and user stories. 4. Validation: This process reviews requirements with stakeholders, for accuracy and completness. 5. Management: This process monitor and update requirements throughout the project lifecycle. The importance of requirements engineering in software development lifecycle ensures that a clear foundation for the project, aligning stakeholder expectations and system goals. It reduces project risk by identifying issues early, leading to accurate planning and efficient resource use, ultimately delivering a product that meets user needs and business objectives.

Software Design Principles: Software design principles are general guidelines and best practices that are used to create software that is maintainable, scalable, and efficient. 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Testing in Software Engineering: Software testing is the process of finding errors in the developed product. It also checks whether the real outcomes can match expected results, as well as aids in the identification of defects, missing requirements, or gaps.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Answer: The Unit testing focuses on verifying individual components or functions in isolation. Integration testing follows, where these units are combined and tested together to identify issues in their interactions. System testing then evaluates the complete and integrated software to ensure it meets the specified requirements and performs correctly in its intended environment. Finally the Acceptance testing involves end-users or clients to validate that the software meets their needs and is ready for deployment. These levels of testing collectively help identify and fix defects, ensuring the software is reliable and performs as expected.   

Version Control Systems: Version Control Systems is a software engineering practice of controlling computer files and version of files; primarily source code text files, but generally any type of file- O'Sullivan Bryan (2009) mercunial : The Definitive Guide

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Answer: Version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files overtime so that one can recall specific versions later. It also allows users to keep track of the changes in software development projects, and enable them to collaborate on those projects. They are important in software development because it enables teams to work in distributed and asychronous environments, manage changes and versions of code and artifacts and resolve merge conflicts and related anomalies. 1. GitHub, its features are pull request, actions, issues, GitHub Pages, Security 2. Gitlab, its features are CI/CD Pipelines, Merge request, Issue tracking, Docker registry, Auto DevOPs. 3. AWS CodeCommit, its features are Scalability, Encryption, Integration, Access control, Notifications, Branch management.

Software Project Management: Software project management is the process of planning and leading software projects. - Stellman, Andrew; Greene, Jennifer(2005). Applied software project management.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Answer: A software project manager plays a vital role in overseeing the planning execution and delivery of software projects. they act as the central point of communication between stakeholders, developers, and other team members ensuring everyone is alligned with project goals and deadlines. Their responsibility is to define and communicate project objectives, scope and deliverables clearly to all stakeholders involved. They are also responsible for ensuring quality throughout the project lifecycle. Challenges faced are Difficulty choosing the right project management tool, Analyzing the conditions, audience and situation, Misalignment between goals and business objectives.

Software Maintenance: Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Answer: Software maintenance is the process of modifying a software product after it has been delivered to the customer and its main purpose is to modify and update software applications after delivery to correct faults and and to improve performance. 1. Corrective maintenance: This involves fixing bugs and errors that are discovered in the software after its deployment. 2. Adaptive maintenance: This type of maintenance is carried out to keep the software compatible with changing environments. 3. Perfective maintenance: This involves making improvements and enhancements to the software based on user feedback and changing requirements.  4. Preventive maintenanace: This focuses on anticipating and addressing potential issues before they become problematic.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering: Ethical considerations in software engineering are crucial to ensuring that software development pactices are responsible, fair and beneficial to society.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Answer: Software engineers grapple with significant concerns, foremost among which is privacy and data protection. They are responsible for ensuring that user data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy laws, safeguarding it from breaches and misuse. Respecting intellectual property rights is another critical issue; engineers must avoid using unlicensed or unattributed code and materials and protect the intellectual property they create. Addressing security vulnerabilities is also crucial, as negleting these can lead to data breaches and user harm.
